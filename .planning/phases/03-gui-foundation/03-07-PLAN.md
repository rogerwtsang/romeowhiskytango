<objective>
Human verification of complete dashboard functionality: layout, resizing, collapsible panels, compare mode, simulation execution, and session restoration.

Purpose: Confirm dashboard meets user requirements before proceeding to Phase 4 (Results Visualization).

Output: Verified working dashboard with all core functionality operational.

  <what-built>
Complete unified dashboard with:
- SetupPanel (with collapsible Assumptions subsection)
- LineupPanel (with inline Run button and progress)
- ResultsPanel (with summary and collapsible details)
- MainDashboard (PanedWindow layout with compare mode)
- Session restoration on startup
  </what-built>

  <how-to-verify>
Launch the application:
```bash
python gui.py
```

**Test 1: Basic Layout**
1. Confirm single dashboard page displays (no tabs)
2. Verify three main sections visible: Setup (top), Lineup (bottom-left), Results (bottom-right)
3. Check that Setup panel has "▼ Assumptions" toggle button

**Test 2: Panel Resizing**
1. Drag vertical divider between Setup and content area
2. Drag horizontal divider between Lineup and Results
3. Confirm panels resize smoothly
4. Resize window - confirm panels resize proportionally

**Test 3: Collapsible Setup**
1. Click Setup panel toggle button (▼ → ▶)
2. Confirm Assumptions section hides
3. Click again (▶ → ▼)
4. Confirm Assumptions section reappears

**Test 4: Lineup Building**
1. Load test data (any team/season)
2. Add players to lineup using controls
3. Verify lineup builder displays in Lineup panel
4. Check control buttons (Add, Move Up, Move Down, Remove) work

**Test 5: Simulation Execution**
1. Build a complete 9-player lineup
2. Click "▶ Run Simulation" button in Lineup panel
3. Confirm progress bar appears inline below Run button
4. Confirm progress updates (percentage increases)
5. Wait for simulation to complete
6. Verify progress bar hides
7. Check Results panel updates with summary metrics

**Test 6: Compare Mode**
1. Click "Compare Mode" button in Lineup panel header
2. Confirm second Lineup panel appears
3. Build different lineup in second panel
4. Click "Compare Mode" again to exit
5. Confirm second panel disappears
6. Verify no memory issues (application remains responsive)

**Test 7: Session Restoration**
1. Configure dashboard (collapse Setup, build lineup, adjust panel sizes)
2. Exit application
3. Restart application: python gui.py
4. Confirm "Restore Session" prompt appears
5. Click "Yes"
6. Verify dashboard restores to previous state:
   - Setup collapse state preserved
   - Lineup data restored
   - Panel sizes approximately restored

**Test 8: Fresh Start**
1. Restart application
2. When prompted, click "No" to session restore
3. Confirm dashboard starts with default state

Expected behaviors:
- All panels render without errors
- Resizing is smooth and responsive
- Collapsible sections work correctly
- Simulation execution completes and updates results
- Compare mode creates/removes panels properly
- Session restoration works
  </how-to-verify>

  <resume-signal>
Type "approved" if all tests pass and dashboard functions correctly.

If issues found, describe specific problems:
- Which test failed
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Screenshots if layout issues
  </resume-signal>
</task>

<success_criteria>
All verification tests pass:
- Dashboard displays as unified page
- Panels are resizable
- Setup panel collapses/expands
- Compare mode works
- Simulation execution updates results
- Session restoration functions correctly
- No crashes or visual glitches
</success_criteria>
