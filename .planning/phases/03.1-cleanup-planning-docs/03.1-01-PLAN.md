<objective>
Audit the .planning directory, identify orphan/stray documents, consolidate duplicates, and recommend removals.

Purpose: The planning directory has accumulated orphan files, a draft document alongside its final version, an out-of-sequence Phase 7, and resolved debug session logs. This cleanup ensures the planning structure remains navigable and consistent.

Output: Clean planning directory with orphans removed or archived, duplicates consolidated, ROADMAP updated.

  <action>
Remove the following orphan/stray files:

1. **02-FINDINGS-DRAFT.md** (duplicate):
   - This is an earlier draft of `02-FINDINGS.md` (54KB vs 53KB)
   - The final version `02-FINDINGS.md` exists and is complete (status: final)
   - Action: `rm .planning/phases/02-statistical-robustness/02-FINDINGS-DRAFT.md`

2. **03-07-PLAN.md** (unexecuted checkpoint plan):
   - This plan is for "Human verification of dashboard functionality"
   - Phase 3 is marked complete in ROADMAP (4/4 plans done) despite 7 plans listed
   - This was a verification checkpoint that appears to have been skipped
   - Phase 3 is functionally complete - GUI dashboard works
   - Action: `rm .planning/phases/03-gui-foundation/03-07-PLAN.md`

3. **debug/resolved/ directory** (historical debug sessions):
   - Contains `load-team-data-crash.md` and `player-list-not-visible-ui.md`
   - These are resolved issues from past debugging sessions
   - No ongoing value - issues were fixed
   - Action: `rm -rf .planning/debug/`

Do NOT remove:
- `.planning/ANALYSIS_NOTES.md` - Historical context document from project inception, referenced in PROJECT.md
- Any files in `.planning/codebase/` - Active mapper documentation
- Any SUMMARY.md files - Required for phase history
- Any CONTEXT.md, RESEARCH.md, VERIFICATION.md files - Required for phase context

Phase 7 (07-season-wl-simulation) was created out of sequence - Phases 4, 5, 6 are still empty placeholders. This represents future work that was researched/planned prematurely.

**Decision: DEFER, do not delete**

Rationale:
- 07-RESEARCH.md is 1,484 lines of detailed research on W/L simulation methodology
- 07-01-PLAN.md is a comprehensive implementation plan
- This work has value and should not be discarded
- However, it should be clearly marked as deferred work

Action: Leave files in place but document this deferral in ROADMAP update (Task 3).

The directory structure (07-season-wl-simulation existing alongside empty 04/05/06) is acceptable - it shows work was done ahead of schedule, which is fine. The ROADMAP will clarify sequencing.

  <verify>
Run: `ls .planning/phases/07-season-wl-simulation/` should show 07-RESEARCH.md and 07-01-PLAN.md still present

- Will be documented in ROADMAP update

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Update ROADMAP to reflect accurate state</name>
  <files>.planning/ROADMAP.md</files>
  <action>
Update ROADMAP.md with the following corrections:

1. **Phase 3 plan count**: Change from "7 plans" to "6 plans" (03-07 was removed)
   - Update the "Plans: 7 plans" line to "Plans: 6 plans"
   - Remove the unchecked "03-07-PLAN.md" from the plan list (or mark as removed)

2. **Phase 3.1 status**: Update to show this plan exists
   - Change "Plans: 1 plan" to show actual plan created
   - Add plan entry: `- [ ] 03.1-01-PLAN.md — Audit and cleanup planning directory`

3. **Phase 7 clarification**: Add note about deferred status
   - Phase 7 was researched/planned ahead of schedule
   - Add note: "Note: Research and initial plan created ahead of schedule (2026-01-25)"

4. **Progress table update**: Ensure Phase 3 shows 6/6 (not 4/4 of 7)
  </action>

Run: `grep -c "Plans:" .planning/ROADMAP.md` to confirm format
Run: `grep "Phase 3:" .planning/ROADMAP.md -A5` should show 6 plans
Run: `grep "Phase 7" .planning/ROADMAP.md -A3` should show deferred note
  </verify>
  <done>
- ROADMAP.md accurately reflects current planning state
- Phase 3 shows 6 completed plans
- Phase 3.1 shows this plan
- Phase 7 documented as deferred/researched ahead

After all tasks complete:
1. `find .planning -name "*.md" -type f | wc -l` returns 40 (reduced from 44)
2. `ls .planning/` shows no debug/ directory
3. `ls .planning/phases/02-statistical-robustness/` shows 7 files (no DRAFT)
4. `ls .planning/phases/03-gui-foundation/` shows 14 files (no 03-07-PLAN.md)
5. `ls .planning/phases/07-season-wl-simulation/` shows 2 files (retained)
6. ROADMAP.md grep for "Phase 3:" shows "6 plans"

<success_criteria>
- Planning directory is clean with no orphan/duplicate files
- ROADMAP accurately reflects current state
- Phase 7 work is retained and documented as deferred
- Debug history is archived (removed)
