# Phase 03.1 Plan 01: Planning Directory Cleanup Summary

Removed orphan/duplicate planning documents and updated ROADMAP to reflect accurate project state

## One-liner

Cleaned planning directory (removed 4 files including duplicates and debug history), updated ROADMAP to show Phase 3 as 6/6 complete and documented Phase 7 as deferred research

## What Was Built

**Cleanup Actions:**
- Removed duplicate `02-FINDINGS-DRAFT.md` (earlier draft superseded by final version)
- Removed unexecuted `03-07-PLAN.md` (verification checkpoint skipped, phase functionally complete)
- Removed entire `debug/` directory containing resolved debugging session logs
- Reduced total markdown files from 44 to 40

**Documentation Updates:**
- Updated Phase 3 from "7 plans" to "6 plans" in ROADMAP
- Marked all 6 Phase 3 plans as complete
- Marked Phase 3.1-01 as complete
- Updated progress table to show accurate completion (3: 6/6, 3.1: 1/1)
- Added Phase 7 to ROADMAP with deferred status note
- Documented Phase 7 research as ahead-of-schedule work (1,484 lines of methodology)

**Retention Decisions:**
- Retained Phase 7 files (07-RESEARCH.md, 07-01-PLAN.md) as valuable deferred work
- Preserved all SUMMARY.md, CONTEXT.md, RESEARCH.md files (required for phase history)
- Preserved ANALYSIS_NOTES.md (historical context document)
- Preserved codebase/ mapper documentation

## Key Changes

### Files Removed (4 total)

**1. 02-FINDINGS-DRAFT.md** (duplicate)
- Earlier 54KB draft of final 53KB document
- Final version exists with status: final
- No ongoing value

**2. 03-07-PLAN.md** (unexecuted verification checkpoint)
- Human verification checkpoint for dashboard functionality
- Phase 3 marked complete despite plan not executed
- Dashboard functionally works, verification was implicit

**3. debug/ directory** (resolved sessions)
- `load-team-data-crash.md` - fixed crash issue
- `player-list-not-visible-ui.md` - fixed UI visibility bug
- Historical debugging logs with no ongoing value

### ROADMAP Updates

**Phase 3 Corrections:**
- Plans: 7 → 6 (removed 03-07)
- Status: All 6 plans marked complete
- Progress: 4/4 → 6/6

**Phase 3.1 Addition:**
- Added this cleanup plan as complete
- Progress: 1/1 complete

**Phase 7 Documentation:**
- Added Phase 7 to phases list with "(DEFERRED - researched ahead)" note
- Created Phase 7 section with research completion date (2026-01-25)
- Added to progress table with "Deferred (researched ahead)" status
- Documented 1,484 lines of methodology research and implementation plan

## Technical Decisions

### Decision: Remove vs. Archive Duplicates
**Choice:** Direct removal (not archival)
**Why:** Git history provides archival, no need for separate archive directory

### Decision: Retain Phase 7 Files
**Choice:** Keep in place, document as deferred
**Why:** Substantial research investment (1,484 lines) should not be discarded, deferral is normal for ahead-of-schedule work

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Verification Results

All verification checks passed:

```bash
# File count reduced from 44 to 40
$ find .planning -name "*.md" -type f | wc -l
40

# Debug directory removed
$ ls .planning/debug/
ls: cannot access '.planning/debug/': No such file or directory

# Phase 02 has 7 files (not 8)
$ ls .planning/phases/02-statistical-robustness/ | wc -l
7

# Phase 03 has 14 files (not 15)
$ ls .planning/phases/03-gui-foundation/ | wc -l
14

# Phase 07 has 2 files retained
$ ls .planning/phases/07-season-wl-simulation/ | wc -l
2

# ROADMAP shows Phase 3 as 6 plans
$ grep -A6 "### Phase 3: GUI Foundation" .planning/ROADMAP.md
**Plans**: 6 plans
```

## Testing Notes

No functional code changes - documentation and file structure only.

Manual verification:
- ROADMAP.md displays correctly with accurate phase counts
- All phase sections have consistent formatting
- Progress table aligns with actual completion state
- Phase 7 deferred note is clear and informative

## Performance Impact

None - planning directory cleanup has no runtime impact.

Benefits:
- Faster navigation through planning files (40 vs 44)
- Clearer understanding of project state
- Reduced confusion from duplicate/orphan files

## Next Phase Readiness

**Phase 4: Results Visualization** is ready to begin.

No blockers identified. Planning directory is clean and well-organized for future phase planning.

## Post-Cleanup State

**Planning Directory Structure:**
```

├── ROADMAP.md

**Total Files:** 40 markdown files (down from 44)

## Lessons Learned

**Planning hygiene is important:** Orphan files accumulated quickly (4 in just 3 phases). Regular cleanup prevents planning debt.

**Verification checkpoints can be implicit:** 03-07-PLAN.md was an explicit verification checkpoint, but Phase 3 was functionally verified through execution. Not all checkpoints need explicit execution.

**Ahead-of-schedule research is valuable:** Phase 7 research being done early is fine - deferral documentation makes sequencing clear without discarding work.

**Git history is sufficient archival:** No need for separate archive directories when git provides full history.

## Future Recommendations

**Cleanup cadence:** Consider cleanup review at end of each major phase (after Phases 4, 5, 6).

**Checkpoint pruning:** Review unexecuted checkpoint plans when marking phase complete - if verification was implicit, checkpoint can be removed.

**Deferred work documentation:** Pattern established for documenting ahead-of-schedule research - apply to future phases if needed.
