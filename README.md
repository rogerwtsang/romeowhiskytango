## Project Overview

This project implements a Monte Carlo simulator to model baseball team performance based on player statistics. The primary research question: **Can we determine the optimal batting order arrangement across a full season?**

### Key Features

#### Simulation Engine
- Player performance modeling from slash line statistics (BA/OBP/SLG)
- **Strikeout rate modeling** with player-specific K% from FanGraphs
- Bayesian-smoothed hit type distribution (1B/2B/3B/HR)
- Probabilistic base-running with configurable aggression
- Stolen base modeling with player-specific SB/CS rates
- Sacrifice fly simulation (excludes strikeouts - no ball in play)
- Error and wild pitch advancement
- Full season simulation (configurable 1-162 games)

#### GUI Application
- **8-tab interface** for complete simulation control
- **Setup Tab**: Team/season selection, simulation parameters
- **Lineup Tab**: Drag-and-drop lineup builder with constraints system
- **Baserunning/Errors/Distribution Tabs**: Fine-tune simulation parameters
- **Run Tab**: Execute simulations with real-time progress
- **Results Management**: Save and compare multiple lineup simulations
- Individual player search and addition from any season

#### Data & Analysis
- FanGraphs data integration via `pybaseball`
- Statistical validation against actual team performance
- Results export to CSV/JSON formats
- Comprehensive statistics: runs, hits, walks, SB/CS, sacrifice flies

## Usage

### GUI Application (Recommended)

Launch the graphical interface:

```bash
python gui.py
```

**Workflow**:
1. **Setup Tab**: Select team (e.g., TOR) and season (2015-2025)
2. **Lineup Tab**: Build your 9-player lineup using drag-and-drop or auto-order
3. **Configure**: Adjust baserunning, errors, and distribution settings (optional)
4. **Run Tab**: Execute simulation (100-100,000 iterations)
5. **Results**: View statistics, histogram, and export to CSV/JSON
6. **Save Results**: Store simulations for later comparison

### Programmatic Usage

```python
from src.data.scraper import get_team_batting_stats
from src.data.processor import prepare_roster
from src.simulation.batch import run_simulations

# Load player data
stats_df = get_team_batting_stats('TOR', 2024)
roster = prepare_roster(stats_df)

# Create lineup (top 9 players by OPS)
lineup = sorted(roster, key=lambda p: p.obp + p.slg, reverse=True)[:9]

# Run 10,000 season simulations
results = run_simulations(
    lineup,
    n_iterations=10000,
    n_games=162,
    random_seed=42
)

# Access results
print(f"Mean runs per season: {results['summary']['runs']['mean']:.1f}")
print(f"95% CI: {results['summary']['runs']['ci_95']}")
```

### Saving and Comparing Lineups

**In GUI**: Use the "Save Results" button to store simulation results, then access them in the Compare tab (coming soon in Sprint 2).

**Programmatically**:
```python
from src.gui.utils.results_manager import ResultsManager

# Create manager
manager = ResultsManager(max_results=10)

# Run and save multiple lineup simulations
for lineup_config in [lineup_a, lineup_b, lineup_c]:
    results = run_simulations(lineup_config, n_iterations=10000)
    manager.store_result(f"Lineup {lineup_config[0].name}", results)

# Compare results
comparison = manager.compare_results([id1, id2])
```
